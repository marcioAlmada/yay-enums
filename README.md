# Enums

"Enumerated Types" polyfill for PHP made with [YAY!](https://github.com/marcioAlmada/yay).
The preprocessor has no bridge for project integration yet, but you can have a taste of it by running:

```bash
# install it
git clone git@github.com:marcioAlmada/yay-enums.git
cd yay-enums
composer install

# run it!
php test.php
```

Please, read [enum.tests.php](https://github.com/marcioAlmada/yay-enums/blob/master/enum.tests.php) to see the specs.

This is inspired by the ["Enumerated Types"](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/enum) RFC.
